# CS171 Final Project:

This final project was a accumulation of the knowledge learned through the first introductory course of the Whitworth CS Program.

# How to run the program:
1. Build the project to create the main.exe folder (this code was created and run in the latest version of Visual Studio Code)
2. Run the project (i.e. terminal -> run task -> run)
3. Results will be output to terminal

# Things that could be used to improve the design given the knowledge I have now (almost a year later)
1. Find a way to import schedules. At the moment, the simulation is set up to only work for the 2021-22 NFL Season. It would be nice to be able to get updated schedules so that the simulation could be used year-to-year. Using file I/O might be a good way for this to be done as well as possibly webscraping (possibly through Python)
2. Try to implement factors outside of just all-time head-to-head records. Looking back on this, now I think that using this metric isn't very indicitive of how good teams are now. Possibily incorporating factors such as more recent data, injuries, etc. would go a long way in improving this simulation.
3. Implementing more Object Oriented Programming might be an effective way to go about breaking down some of the issues further. Possibly making some objects like "Divisions" and "Conferences" would possibly help in terms of other functions that were done (like when we had to figure out who made the playoffs at the end of a regular season).
